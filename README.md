## Introduction

- Trivy is a comprehensive, easy-to-use open source vulnerability scanner for container images. Since its introduction two years ago, the project has gained a broad following among open source community members. 

- I’m excited to share that it has now become the first container image vulnerability scanner to surpass 8,000 GitHub stars, making it the world's leading scanner.

- Unlike other open source scanners, Trivy covers both OS packages and language-specific dependencies and is easy to integrate into organizations’ software development pipelines.
